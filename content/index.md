My website using Anax Flat
===============================

Hi there.

Dis my new me-page using Anax flat. My name is Anton and the purpose of this site
is for use in a course im taking. I'm studying webprogramming and this is one of the courses in that program, webdesign.
I'm the kind of guy who spends plenty of time in front of my computer, so I thought I'd make a go at making a career of it.
This right here is one of the steps towards that goal. Look around and check out my site.
